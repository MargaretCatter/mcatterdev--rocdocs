## Devlog Notes

There is a special place in hell because for the life of me I can not figure out how to get the inded.mdx to work properly. As of 16:30 I'm giving up for the week and will try to figure it out next week. Might ask on the gatsby discord for help as well as posting a question on the github page for the theme.
