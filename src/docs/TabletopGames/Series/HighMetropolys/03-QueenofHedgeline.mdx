The Red Lich Queen of Hedgeline is set in a city called Hedgeline (aka the Hedge) which is a fictional county in the North-Eastern portion of the United States of America. Hedgeline is a city covered in mist and perpetual fog. It is a well-developed bustling industrial city despite its near-constant dreary covering. There are light rail trains, electrical cars, bikes going to and fro, as well as a complex telecommunication network, however most of this was built decades ago and is simply maintained but not innovated upon. It is crowded with row houses, smooth paved roads, and is in a near-perfect circular grid.

The city is also cloaked with a veil of magic and the occult permeating its every inch. Among the human population of the Hedge walks The Others.

The Red Lich Queen of Hedgeline is a game about the struggles and defiant uprising of a group of citizens against their tyrannical government to find their own feet and freedom.
